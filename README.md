# BUROCRACIA_JAJA
Code for my single [*BUROCRACIA_JAJA*](https://geikha.bandcamp.com/album/burocracia-jaja-coded-02), which is in itself an edit of the song *30 Grados* by El Turko & Mandale Flow. Made using [TidalCycles](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal) and [SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider).

## About this repo

### TidalCycles

`BUROCRACIA_JAJA.tidal` contains the code of the song itself. While the `SETUP_250107.tidal` file all possible dependencies for this code, as it's my own personal setup file.

### SuperCollider

The `SC` folder contains a minimal boot for the project. The `SYNTHDEFS` folder contains many of the synths and effects I use as of time of upload.

### Samples

Samples are missing as of now, I'll upload asap.
<!-- Samples are stored in an encrypted .zip file, you can use the password `geikha` to unzip them. This is just a minor measure given some samples count as copyrighted material. -->
